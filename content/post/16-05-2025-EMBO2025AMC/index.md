# EMBO practical course: Transposable Elements in the Era of Data Science

Mrs. Andreza Matosso da Cunha, master student in our lab, was one of 20 researchers selected, from around the world, to attend the practical course on Transposable Elements organized by the European Molecular Biology Organization, in the United Kingdom. Andreza≈õ participation was supported by EMBO, with a travel grant and registration free waiver, and also supported by [FEALQ](https://fealq.org.br/), and [CAPES - PROEX](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/acoes-e-programas/bolsas/bolsas-no-pais/proex). Andreza is studying the expression of transposable elements, and its relationship with stress reponse in grasses.
