# Plant and Animal Genome Conferece - 32nd - 10th to 15th january, San Diego, CA, USA 

[The Plant and Animal Genome Conference (PAG)](https://intlpag.org/PAG32/) is an annual event held in San Diego, California, every January, bringing together leading researchers, industry professionals, and students in the field of genomics. As one of the largest gatherings focused on agricultural genomics, PAG serves as a platform for sharing the latest advances in plant and animal genetics, biotechnology, and bioinformatics. The conference features plenary talks, workshops, poster sessions, and networking opportunities, fostering collaboration among scientists working on genome sequencing, gene editing, and trait discovery to improve global food security and sustainability.

Here is a list of research projects involving our lab members and collaborators that were presented at this year's PAG conference.

- [Renato A. C. dos Santos](/author/renato-augusto-correa-dos-santos/) presented his wotk titled "CoNekT Grasses Microbiome enables the network analysis for microbial co-occurrence and integration of host RNAseq mand microbiome data", part of a research internship he carried out in the lab of Prof. Wallace at the University of Georgia.

- Isabel R. Gerhardt, collaborator from the Genomics for Climate Change Research Center, presented the work titled ["The Odd One out: Genomic Clues from an Evergreen Species within the Angiosperm Family with the Largest Number of Desiccation-Tolerant Species"](https://pag.confex.com/pag/32/late/papers/viewonly.cgi?password=163480&username=59735)

- Drielli Canal, collaborator from UNICAMP, presented the work titled: ["Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Patterns in Hybridizing Neotropical Bromeliads"](https://pag.confex.com/pag/32/poster/papers/viewonly.cgi?password=205504&username=58159)

- Clarisse Palma-Silva, collaborator from UNICAMP, presented the work titled: ["Pangenome of Local Adaptation in Bromeliads Along the Mountains of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest"](https://pag.confex.com/pag/32/work/papers/viewonly.cgi?password=570785&username=58771)

- Jacqueline Salvi de Mattos, presented the work titled "Chromosome-scale genome assembly in the orchid Epidendrum fulgens reveals insights for environmental adaptation"
