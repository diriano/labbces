This project focuses on *Moniliophthora roreri*, the fungal pathogen responsible for frosty pod rot, a disease that severely impacts cacao and related *Theobroma* species such as cupuaçu and macambo. Known for its wide host range, high pathogenicity, and adaptability to diverse ecological niches, *M. roreri* poses a major threat to cacao production in the Americas and could endanger other global production areas if it spreads further.

The main goal is to construct and analyze a graph-based pangenome using 24 publicly available *M. roreri* genomes to capture the species’ full genomic diversity. This approach overcomes limitations of single-reference genomes by enabling the identification of core, accessory, and unique genomic regions, and by providing a high-resolution view of structural variations.
