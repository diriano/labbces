# Blast Server

We have a public blast server that provides access to some of the datasets generated by members of the group. [There](http://labbces.cena.usp.br:4567/) you can find our current polyploid genome assembly for SP80-3280 (assembly B2) and a version of a pan-transcriptome assembly (longest transcript of group, Scp.v1) derived from 50 sugarcane genotypes.

The following databases are available in our blast server:

| DB name | DB type | Description | Number of sequences in DB |

Further details about the sugarcane pan-transcriptome can be found in the [Felipe Vaz Perez Master Dissertation](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/64/64133/tde-22052025-110836/en.php).

# Digital Northern

We took the 20 year-old data generated as part of the SUCEST project, and made a new minning application of gene expression values per library, available [here](https://bces.shinyapps.io/ESTs_App/), the EST libraries shown there are described in this [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14613979/). We created this app, because this dataset is the only one available that includes callus.

We also created a [new app](https://bces.shinyapps.io/B2quant_App/), with expression values of genes annoted in our new genome assembly of cultivar SP80-3280. This will be available for the time being until we have the final version of the assembly and annotation adn move everything into Conekt Grasses.

# CoCoView

Are you interested in visualizing codon conservation from multiple sequences alignments. The traditional implementation of SequenceLogos cannot do that, this is why we developed CoCoView, check our [tool](https://github.com/labbces/CoCoView) and its companion [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35990812/).

# PloidyNGS

You have a reference genome, some short read genomics data, and whant to get a feeling of the ploidy of you object of study, say no more, use our tool [PloidyNGS](https://github.com/diriano/ploidyNGS), check out also its companion [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28383704/)
