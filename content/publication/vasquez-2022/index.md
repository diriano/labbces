abstract: Antifolates such as methotrexate (MTX) have been largely known as anticancer
  agents because of their role in blocking nucleic acid synthesis and cell proliferation.
  Their mechanism of action lies in their ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the
  folic acid cycle, especially human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR). However, most
  of them have a classical structure that has proven ineffective against melanoma,
  and, therefore, inhibitors with a non-classical lipophilic structure are increasingly
  becoming an attractive alternative to circumvent this clinical resistance. In this
  study, we conducted a protocol combining virtual screening (VS) and cell-based assays
  to identify new potential non-classical hDHFR inhibitors. Among 173 hit compounds
  identified (average logP = 3.68; average MW = 378.34 Da), two-herein, called C1
  and C2-exhibited activity against melanoma cell lines B16 and A375 by MTT and Trypan-Blue
  assays. C1 showed cell growth arrest (39% and 56%) and C2 showed potent cytotoxic
  activity (77% and 51%) in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of C2 on A375 cell
  viability were greater than MTX (98% vs 60%) at equivalent concentrations and times.
  Our results indicate that the integrated in silico/in vitro approach provided a
  benchmark to identify novel promising non-classical DHFR inhibitors showing activity
  against melanoma cells.
