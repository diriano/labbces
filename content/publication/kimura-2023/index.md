abstract: Biodiversity is proposed as a sustainable alternative for the economic development
  of high-biodiversity regions. Especially in the field of biodiversity genomics,
  the development of low-cost DNA sequencing opens an opportunity for new actors beyond
  academia to engage in genomic sequencing. However, it is challenging to adequately
  compensate non-academic actors such as local populations for their contribution
  to the innovation process, preventing better bioeconomy development. Although many
  repositories register genomic data to support biodiversity research, they do not
  facilitate the fair sharing of economic benefits. In this work, we propose the creation
  of the Amazon Biobank, a community-based genetic database. We employed blockchain
  to build a transparent and verifiable log of transactions involving genomic data,
  and we used smart contracts to implement an internal monetary system for all participants
  who collect, insert, process, store, and validate genomic data. We also used peer-to-peer
  solutions to allow users with commodity computers to collaborate with the storage
  and distribution of DNA files. By combining emerging technologies, Amazon Biobank
  provides adequate benefit-sharing among all participants that collaborate with data,
  knowledge, and computational resources. It also provides traceability and auditability,
  allowing easy association between biotechnological research and DNA data. In addition,
  the solution is highly scalable and less dependent on the trust deposited in any
  system player. Therefore, Amazon Biobank can become an important stepping stone
  to unlock the potential of bioeconomy in rich ecosystems such as the Amazon Rainforest.
