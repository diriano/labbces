abstract: The Arecaceae family comprises economically, and ecologically significant
  palm species widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions. Among them,
  Acrocomia aculeata, commonly known as Macauba, has gained attention due to its high
  oil yield, environmental adaptability, and potential applications in sustainable
  agriculture and bioenergy production. This study presents the first chromosome scale
  genome assembly of A. aculeata and the first reference genome of the genus, using
  Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing, PacBio HiFi and Hi-C proximity ligation
  data. The genome covers 1.94 Gbp in the 15 pseudochromosomes, with N50 of 143.43
  Mbp, achieving a base quality QV of 76.4 and a k-mer completeness of 90.58% of PacBio
  HiFi data. Interspersed repetitive regions represents 77.36% of the total genome,
  with long terminal repeat (LTRs) accounting for 54.98%. A total of 28.204 protein-coding
  genes were predicted. The genome was validated with BUSCO analysis, achieving a
  high completeness of 98.3% for predicted proteins. The first chromosome scale genome
  of Macauba can provide new insights and breakthroughs for studies of conservation
  genomics and plant breeding programs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have
  declared no competing interest.Acelen Renovaveis, FEALQ 104.781FAPESP, 2021/10319-0CNPq,
