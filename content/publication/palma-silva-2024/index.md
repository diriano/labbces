abstract: "Environmental stress is a fundamental facet of life and a significant driver\
  \ of natural selection in the wild. Gene expression diversity may facilitate adaptation\
  \ to environmental changes, without necessary genetic change, but its role in adaptive\
  \ divergence remains largely understudied in Neotropical systems. In Amazonian riparian\
  \ forests, species distribution is predominantly influenced by species' waterlogging\
  \ tolerance. The flooding gradient delineates distinct wetland forest types, shaping\
  \ habitats and species characteristics. Here we investigated the molecular basis\
  \ of environmental stress response in a tropical ground-herb species (Ischnosiphon\
  \ puberulus) to environmental variation in Amazonian riparian forests. We compared\
  \ environmental variables and gene expression profiles from individuals collected\
  \ in two forest types: Igapó and Terra firme in the Amazonian riparian forests.\
  \ Predictable seasonal flooding poses a significant challenge in Igapó compared\
  \ to Terra firme environments, with the former presenting higher water column height\
  \ and longer flooding duration. Our findings suggest that contrasting environmental\
  \ conditions related to flooding regimes are important drivers of population genetic\
  \ differentiation and differential gene expression in I. puberulus. Enriched gene\
  \ ontology terms highlight associations with environmental stresses, such as defence\
  \ response, water transport, phosphorylation, root development, response to auxin,\
  \ salicylic acid and oxidative stress. By uncovering key environmental stress response\
  \ pathways conserved across populations, I. puberulus offers novel genetic insights\
  \ into the molecular basis of plant reactions to environmental constraints found\
  \ in flooded areas of this highly biodiverse neotropical ecosystem."
