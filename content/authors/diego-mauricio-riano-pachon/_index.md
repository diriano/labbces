Prof. Riãno-Pachón has a bachelor in Biology from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (2001), a Doctorate in Plant Molecular Biology from the Universitaet Potsdam (2008), a Postdoc in Bioinformatics from the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology (2010), and a postdoc in applied bioinformatics for microalgae from the Institute of Chemistry, University of São Paulo (2018). Since May 2018 he is an Assistant Professor at the Center for Nuclear Energy in Agriculture (CENA/USP). Since May 2019 participates as a member of the Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia do Bioetanol (CNPq/MCTIC). His areas of expertise are biology, bioinformatics and computational and evolutionary biology. He is interested in the evolution of biological networks in general, and gene regulatory networks in particular; as well as in the evolution of gene families, molecular characterization of organisms, predicting the function of non-coding RNAs, genome assembly and annotation, machine learning, classification problems, identification and evolution of protein domains and the development of integrative databases for omics data. Recently, in his research group, they have been working mostly with data coming from Next Generation Sequencing technologies. They have dealt with 454, Illumina, Oxford Nanopore and PacBio datasets in order to reconstruct full genome sequences and call polymorphims from bacteria, green algae, angiosperms and fungi. They have also reconstructed complex transcriptomes from angiosperms and fungi, focused on organisms interactions and enzyme and biofuel production, in order to elucidate their molecular basis. Between January 2017 and April 2018 Prof. Riaño-Pachón was a postdoctoral guest researcher in the Laboratory of Regulatory Systems Biology lead by Prof. Dr. Flavia Vischi Winck at IQ/USP. From February 2013 and November 2016 he was a researcher at the Labóratorio Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia do Bioetanol part of the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa em Energia e Materiais, Campinas, Brazil, leading the research group in Computational, Evolutionary and Systems Biology. Between August 2010 and December 2012 he was the leader of the research group 'Computational and Evolutionary Biology' at the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia, while serving as Assistant Professor in Computational Biology/Bioinformatics. Since 2018 he is the proud father of a wonderful baby girl.
