Sequenceserver has it own user in the server

The configuration file is located in /home/sequenceserver/.sequenceserver.conf

In order to know where sequenceserver is installed, logged as the proper user run:

echo "$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.path[0]')/gems/sequenceserver-2.1.0"

To the databases available:

sequenceserver --list_databases

There is a systemd autostart script in /etc/systemd/system/sequenceserver.service 
The content of the script is the following:

```

-- Adding new databases

Add the fasta file to /Databig/BLAST_DBs

Stop the seqeunceserver

  service sequenceserver stop

and format the DBs:

  ~/.sequenceserver/ncbi-blast-2.12.0+/bin/makeblastdb  -in /DataBig/BLAST_DBs/file.fasta -dbtype prot -title 'DB title'

Restart the sequenceserver

  service sequenceserver start

Alternatively database could be formated with (after adding the fasta file to the proper path)

  sequenceserver --make-blast-databases

However this uses the 'parse_seqids' option of makeblastdb, which will fail if the DB identifiers are larger than 50 chars.

In order to add links to blast results add the proper code here:

  /usr/local/ruby-3.2.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.2.0/gems/sequenceserver-2.1.0/lib/sequenceserver/links.rb
